/**
 * Vreamio Feature Gate Hook
 *
 * Reads subscription status and exposes tier-based feature flags.
 * Only three features are gated behind Vreamio+:
 *   1. Family Profiles ("Who's Watching") — TorBox multi-IP enables simultaneous streams
 *   2. Native In-App Scrapers — 11 direct scrapers for zero addon dependency
 *   3. Managed TorBox — auto-provisioned, zero-setup debrid
 *
 * Everything else (MPV player, subtitle customization, quality presets,
 * source selection, cloud sync, library) is free for all users.
